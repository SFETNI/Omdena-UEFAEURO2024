The justification for using regression models is that they allow us to predict a continuous target variable based on various player performance metrics. These models help us understand the factors contributing to high player performance and quantify their impact.\n","\n","1. **Linear Regression:** Provided a basic understanding but failed to capture the complexity of the relationships.\n","2. **Ridge Regression:** Added regularization but did not significantly improve performance.\n","3. **Gradient Boosting Regressor:** Showed improvement by capturing non-linear relationships but still lacked optimal performance.\n","4. **Random Forest Regressor:** Achieved exceptional results after hyperparameter tuning, demonstrating its ability to capture complex interactions and relationships.\n","\n","#### Target Variable\n","\n","The target variable for our machine learning models is a composite Performance Rating Score, which combines several key player features such as goals, assists, minutes played, and advanced metrics. This score is calculated using a weighted average or a scoring algorithm that reflects the relative importance of each feature.\n","\n","#### Success Metrics\n","\n","Our success metrics for evaluating the models are:\n","\n","- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures the average magnitude of errors between the predicted and actual performance scores. A lower MAE indicates a better-performing model.\n","- **R-squared (R²):** Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. A higher R² value indicates a better fit for the model.\n","This version accurately reflects the use of multiple models in the analysis.\n","\n","\n","## **Steps to Implement the Analysis**\n","\n","1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**\n","   - Load player datasets from fbref.com for the years 2012, 2016, 2021, and 2024.\n","   - Clean and preprocess the data, including dropping unnecessary columns and standardizing column names.\n","\n","2. **Feature Engineering:**\n","   - Create new features such as efficiency metrics (e.g., goals per 90 minutes) and a composite performance rating score.\n","\n","3. **Model Training and Evaluation:**\n","   - Split the data into training and testing sets.\n","   - Train the regression model on the training set and evaluate its performance using the testing set.\n","\n","4. **Analysis and Visualization:**\n","   - Identify the top-performing players in each tournament.\n","   - Visualize player performance trends and key performance indicators.\n","\n","By following these steps, we aim to gain valuable insights into player performance in the UEFA Euro tournaments and develop a reliable model for predicting future player performance."],"metadata":{"id":"2h67Tvlntnqi"},"id":"2h67Tvlntnqi"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"f0d62923","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"f0d62923","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719951456200,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":19892,"user":{"displayName":"Carlos Rodriguez","userId":"04567056169439968244"}},"outputId":"234867b6-0ae2-476b-f7f2-2ee5c27aa8b7"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}],"source":["# Mount Google drive\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Import necessary libraries and packages\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, Ridge\n","from xgboost import XGBRegressor\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\n","\n","from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n","from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, r2_score\n","\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns"],"metadata":{"id":"VC8zhJparo6B","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719955298383,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":223,"user":{"displayName":"Carlos Rodriguez","userId":"04567056169439968244"}}},"id":"VC8zhJparo6B","execution_count":17,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Load in the datasets\n","player_stats_2012= pd.read_csv('/content/drive/My Drive/UEFA Euro Player Stats Data/2012_fbref_uefa_euro_player_stats.csv')\n","player_stats_2016= pd.read_csv('/content/drive/My Drive/UEFA Euro Player Stats Data/2016_fbref_uefa_euro_player_stats.csv')\n","player_stats_2021= pd.read_csv('/content/drive/My Drive/UEFA Euro Player Stats Data/2021_fbref_uefa_euro_player_stats.csv')\n","player_stats_2024= pd.read_csv('/content/drive/My Drive/UEFA Euro Player Stats Data/2024_fbref_uefa_euro_player_stats.csv')"],"metadata":{"id":"o1OQFKFQrwbz","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719951480838,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":2122,"user":{"displayName":"Carlos Rodriguez","userId":"04567056169439968244"}}},"id":"o1OQFKFQrwbz","execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Feature Engineering**\n","\n","In the following step, we aim to create new features that will help us better understand and evaluate player performance across different UEFA Euro tournaments.

After hyperparameter tuning, the Random Forest model demonstrated exceptional performance.\n","\n","### **Model Exploration and Performance**\n","\n","#### Linear Regression\n","\n","First, we implemented a simple linear regression model to predict player ratings based on performance metrics. Linear regression models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.\n","\n","- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 0.41475090884825866\n","- **R-squared (R²):** 0.06939271217140042\n","\n","The low R² value indicated that the linear model could only explain about 6.9% of the variance in player ratings, suggesting that the relationship between the features and the target variable is not adequately captured by a simple linear model.\n","\n","#### Ridge Regression\n","\n","Next, we applied Ridge regression, a linear model that includes a regularization term to prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients.\n","\n","- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 0.41476941030296677\n","- **R-squared (R²):** 0.06919973606167829\n","\n","The performance of the Ridge regression model was very similar to that of the simple linear regression model, indicating that regularization did not significantly improve the model’s ability to explain the variance in player ratings.\n","\n","#### Gradient Boosting Regressor (XGBoost)\n","\n","We then tried the Gradient Boosting Regressor, which builds an ensemble of trees sequentially, with each tree trying to correct the errors of the previous ones. This model is known for its ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships.\n","\n","- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 0.2562355949444806\n","- **R-squared (R²):** 0.5977508653405955\n","\n","The Gradient Boosting model showed some improvement over the linear models, explaining about 59.8% of the variance in player ratings. However, the improvement was not substantial enough, indicating that further optimization was needed.\n","\n","### Random Forest Regressor\n","\n","Finally, we implemented a Random Forest Regressor, an ensemble method that fits multiple decision trees on various sub-samples of the dataset and averages the results to improve the predictive accuracy and control overfitting.\n","\n","#### Initial Results\n","\n","- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 0.030179411764706288\n","- **R-squared (R²):** 0.9688936433270304\n","\n","The initial results from the Random Forest Regressor were already significantly better than those from the previous models. The model explained approximately 96.9% of the variance in player ratings, indicating a very good fit.\n","\n","#### Hyperparameter Tuning\n","\n","To further optimize the model, we performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to find the best combination of hyperparameters. We explored a range of values for the number of trees (`n_estimators`), maximum depth of the trees (`max_depth`), minimum number of samples required to split an internal node (`min_samples_split`), minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node (`min_samples_leaf`), and whether bootstrap samples were used (`bootstrap`).\n","\n","- **Best Hyperparameters:** {'learning_rate': 0.05, 'max_depth': 7, 'n_estimators': 100, 'subsample': 1.0}\n","- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 0.02954705882353009\n","- **R-squared (R²):** 0.9695695297126846\n","\n","### Conclusion\n","\n","The hyperparameter-tuned Random Forest Regressor provided an excellent fit for the data, capturing the complex relationships between the features and the player ratings. This improvement suggests that non-linear models, particularly ensemble methods like Random Forest, are highly suitable for this type of analysis.\n","\n","#### Model Performance Metrics\n","\n","- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 0.02954705882353009\n","  - The MAE measures the average magnitude of errors between the predicted and actual player ratings. A lower MAE indicates better predictive accuracy. In this case, the MAE of approximately 0.0295 means that, on average, the predicted ratings are within 0.03 points of the actual ratings. This level of accuracy is exceptional, suggesting that the model's predictions are very close to the true player ratings.\n","\n","- **R-squared (R²):** 0.9695695297126846\n","  - The R² value represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (player ratings) that is predictable from the independent variables (performance metrics). An R² value of approximately 0.97 indicates that 97% of the variability in player ratings is explained by the model. This high R² value demonstrates that the model has a strong explanatory power and effectively captures the underlying patterns in the data.\n","\n","#### Success of the Model\n","\n","The results from the hyperparameter-tuned Random Forest Regressor are impressive, showcasing its ability to make highly accurate predictions and explain a significant portion of the variance in player ratings. This success can be attributed to several factors:\n","\n","1. **Complex Relationships:** The Random Forest model is capable of capturing complex, non-linear relationships between features and the target variable, which simpler linear models failed to do.\n","\n","2. **Ensemble Method:** As an ensemble method, Random Forest combines the predictions of multiple decision trees, which helps in reducing overfitting and improving generalization to unseen data.\n","\n","3. **Robustness and Accuracy:** The very low MAE and high R² values indicate that the model is both robust and accurate. It consistently produces predictions that are very close to the actual ratings, making it a reliable tool for evaluating player performance.\n","\n","4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The process of hyperparameter tuning was crucial in optimizing the model's performance. By exploring a range of hyperparameters, we were able to identify the best configuration that maximized the model's predictive power.\n","\n","#### **Implications for Predicting Player Ratings for UEFA Euro Tournaments**\n","\n","The successful application of the hyperparameter-tuned Random Forest Regressor for predicting player ratings has significant implications for UEFA Euro tournaments. This model can serve as a powerful tool for coaches, analysts, and scouts to evaluate player performance comprehensively and accurately. By leveraging a wide range of performance metrics, the model provides a detailed assessment of each player's contribution, allowing for more informed decision-making in team selection and strategy formulation.\n","\n","Furthermore, the model's ability to explain a substantial portion of the variance in player ratings highlights its potential for identifying key performance indicators that contribute to a player's success on the field. This insight can drive targeted training programs and performance improvement plans, ultimately enhancing team performance in UEFA Euro
